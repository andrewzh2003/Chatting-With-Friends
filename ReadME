HelLo, this is documentation of our project

notes: there is no flourish as I am already submiting this assignment late

A5:
The main file to run will be the a5 python file, as it will create a goey to display the 
messages between users.
You start up the file and you will either create a new file or load up a previously created DSU file
tat will store messages sent and recieved by other users. The program also automatically recieves new messages
sent every 5 seconds by the updateMessage function in teh MainAPP class in the a5 file. 
You can also send messages to users you already have contact with or send new messages to a new user
with the setting 'add contact'
You write the messages you want to send in the bottom right text box and press save post to send it

Profile:
lots of changes were made to the profile class, and in all honestly most of the changes made the code 
more confusing

We tried to create a better system to messages, as we needed to rebuild whole conversations. So we added
sender and reciepent tags in Post objects, allowing us to create a dictionary, storing every
conversation with every other user that our user had contact with. 
We also made a new class called MessageHandler in the profile module, that took in the large list of json
direct messages the user recieved, and grouped them together by sender. This allowed us to abstract away
the data recieved from the server.

DS_messenger:
Follows the requirements, has the send function and the class of direct messages, that we didnt use, we 
probably shouldve.
